# Background

I'm born and raised in San Francisco, CA and have lived in the Bay Area my entire life. I went to elementary school at Francis Scott Key in the Sunset District, middle school at Lawton Alternative School also in the Sunset District, and high school at Oceana in Pacifica, CA. I started getting into technology as a child at 10 years old when I got into computer gaming and had trouble running a particular map in a game I was playing, America's Army. I was in a clan with older folks and they informed me that I need to upgrade my video card in order to play the map and that's when I began doing research on computer hardware to find out how I can replace my video card. I convinced my mom to buy me my first video card which was a 64 MB AGP card that I put into my Compaq Presario running Windows 98. From then on I was hooked on computing beyond just video games. I built my first computer at 11 years old with some help from my older cousin's husband and have loved technology since. Over the years I would always work on hardware projects and got into web development in college when I took a front-end web developer course.

# Work History

My career began in 2013 at Esurance when my God brother recommended me for a position at the NOCC (network operations and control center) which oversaw the entire infrastructure of Esurance, internal and external. I was expecting to continue my career in IT, but after exploring some options, decided I enjoyed development much more than working in IT. I was given the opportunity to replace the email developer and campaign manager who was already leaving the position in the marketing department. Knowing nothing about email marketing, or development for that matter, I hit the ground running and started to learn everything I could about email marketing. After a few weeks, I was already comfortable, creating and launching email campaigns.

In 2018, I decided to pursue new opportunities and got a job at Ipsy, a cosmetics subscription box company. I was working as an email developer and settign up campaigns. During the COVID lockdowns, I decided to finally learn modern web development and chase my true passion to become a full-stack developer. After spending a year learning React development, I showed my manager what I accomplished and he recommended me to the web development team where I transferred over. I was a front-end developer for a year until we had a change in company leadership and 20% of employees were laid off, myself included.

Soon after the lay off, I landed a job back in email development where I worked at an agency, AKQA, working for their biggest client, Apple. There I worked on building their emails using their propriarary WYSIWYG software. During this time, they were also updating their codebase from two separate repos, one for desktop and one for mobile, into one monolithic codebase that supported both. I was heading that project to provide code for other software engineers to implement in their propriatary system. I left before the project was completed and I hope that my code lives on being distributed to inboxes today.

After working at AKQA for a year, I got a job at Prosper, a fin-tech company in San Francisco, as a lifecycle marketing specialist. Here I work on building email templates from scratch, setting up campaigns, launching campaigns, conducting A/B testing, updating legacy code bases, and bringing new ideas to the table in order to boost acquisition. I also helped standardize the codebase by creating components in code snippets that easily plug into email templates to quickly stand up great looking emails that are up to our design standards. I'm also working towards moving dozens of emails from their legacy SMTP system to Iterable.
